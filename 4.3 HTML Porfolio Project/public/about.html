<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I want to learn how to code so that I can make my ideas into reality. There are ways that I could streamline my daily life with coding, improve my website, and work for the companies that inspire me.
   I'd like to make more money, be able to work from different cities, and I'd like to have a career that embraces technology.
  
  I would be able to make applications, work for my friend's companies, be able to make better trading algorithms, as well as have a job that if I have a cold I can still work and not get other people sick. 
I could make lots of ideas using crypto currencies such as selling of digital licenses and designing music software</p>

<p>Coding would change my life because I would be able to understand crypto projects code better.
  I would be able to design my own course webstie for music, design a Ai chat bot and Crm and save money.
I'd be able to make my astrological trading script in trading view. I would be able to apply to work at more companies and I would have a skill I could teach if I became a master</p>

<p>When I'm a professional programmer my family would be able to relax knowing that I have a good job and something that is always going to be needed. 
  They will see that my liberal arts thinking combined with a hard skill like programming was a good choice and my creativity will meet usefullness. They will be proud of me. It could inspire my brothers and they will know I can take of them or give them a job if need bbe. 
</p>

<p>If I don't learn to code then I will always feel stuck and frustrated and worried. Currently I'm still in Brentwood teaching guitar which is going great. But I want to leave Brentwood at some point. 
  I want to live in a more bustling city. I want to be able to hang out with my friends at night. I want to have a job with better benefits. I feel like there's nothing else left to grow for me. 
</p>

<p>My life would habe a lot more freedom and problem solving. I would be able to manage my time much better. 
  I would be able to work on things that challenge me and push me to be better rather than me pushing others to be better. 
  I would meet new people and help make new things come true. I would feel like 10 more career options would open up to me. I would know that I could have a good relationship, move out in my own apartment, and that I'd have money to save for retirement.
